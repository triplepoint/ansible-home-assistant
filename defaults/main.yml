# rendered into the {{home_assistant_host_config_dir}} configuration directory.

# values should be any resolveable Ansible template file path.
# Note that Home Assistant will create several config files of its own, the first
# time it's run, if they don't exist already.  This configuration shouldn't be
# used to generate stock config files, and is here to allow custom configuration
# to be added.
